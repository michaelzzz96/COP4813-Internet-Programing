<h2>About Me</h2>
</div>

<p> Hello, my name is Michael Zulfekar. I'm 23 years old attending the University of North Florida. I was born in Queens, New York and moved to Jacksonville, Florida around 2004 when my family decided they had 
enough of the cold New York weather and wanted to live in a life of humid subtopical climate. </p>
  
<p> Currently, I am working part time at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick-fil-A" target="_blank"> Chick-fil-A</a>. It's by the most interesting the job I've had so far. I enjoy interacting with the customers
I serve and the employees I work with.</p>

Taking photos allows you to express yourself creativity. Some of the type of photos I take are  plants. Below is a photo a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helianthus"  target="_blank">sunflower</a> I took a picture of.
